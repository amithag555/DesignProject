            <h2>Elad Levi - tour guide</h2>

            <p>
              Apparently I did not just become a tour guide, I was born in Kibbutz Maoz Haim in 1953 and grew up in the
              joint education. Contrary to expectations, I have no traumas from the co-education that can be made into a
              film. On the contrary: my childhood in the kibbutz was good (except for the cold, humidity and mud in
              winter), and as close to nature as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              After graduating from high school, I trained youth working in Tivon as part of a year of service and then
              enlisted in the army.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1982, I completed my academic studies in undergraduate studies in biology ("Oranim", University of
              Haifa). I then educated and taught (so I hope) biology, for sixteen years at the "Genius of the Jordan" -
              the joint school in Neve Eitan. While teaching at the school, I continued my studies for master's and
              doctoral degrees (biology-physiology) at the Hebrew University of Givat Ram, Jerusalem.
            </p>

            <p>
              From my childhood I dreamed of traveling to Africa, and when one of the students who studied with me for
              the first degree revealed to me that a travel company had been set up, looking for guides to Africa - I
              immediately jumped on the bandwagon. During the school holidays, I guided trips to Kenya as part of the
              "Geographical Society" and gained a lot of experience in guiding. Since then, I choose every day to
              re-guide tours in Israel and abroad with an emphasis on humans and nature.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1997, I started working as a research physiologist at the Naval Institute of Marine Medicine, and for
              24 years I got up every morning (almost) with great interest and great curiosity for research.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my trips in Israel, I meet my travelers with migratory and regular birds in the fish ponds and
              along the Jordan, with respirators, porcupines, jackals and foxes on night trips, and with the fascinating
              works of the sculptor Assaf Lifshitz at Kibbutz Maoz Haim.
            </p>

            <p>I maintain my energy and sanity, every morning anew - in my encounter with nature and the world.</p>

            <p>Invites you to join the experience - nature is wonderful.</p>

            In March 2006, Elad's agency opened a tourist information center in the Old City of Akko. The main goal of
            the Center – which is run by the Western Galilee Now association in cooperation with local tour operators –
            is to serve as a gateway to the entire Western Galilee for the 2 million tourists arriving in Akko every
            year.
